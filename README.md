# microscope-brightness-tile
Brightness correction and tiling for microscope output.

# Changes from the pre-git version
- Updated to fix buffer error (which was caused by loading all images together)
- Included code that reads the text file for x and y coordinates
- Prints the start time of color correction, end time, and program end time 
- Print name of each image file once it is processed (to help keep track)
